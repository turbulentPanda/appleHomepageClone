## Project Goal:

Clone an Archived Version of the apple.com Homepage: https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/ 

## Project Motivation:

To practice using CSS background-images, gradients, and positioning techniques.

## What I Learned:

This was my first practice with using background images and gradients in CSS. It was not super challenging, but it did present some interesting practice with CSS positioning techniques (i.e., CSS Grid).

It was a fun project!

## Things to Polish:

Mobile compatibility and responsive design. The navbar gradient isn't an exact match, so I might try to fix that in hte future.
